        <h2>Wonderfully fluffy breadsticks that go great with any Italian dish!</h2>
        <p>These breadsticks are amazing. If making exactly as written, note that you can use sugar in place of the honey. The dough should be smooth and easy to work with. Also note oven temperaures may vary, so check your sticks early if making for the first time. These are quick and easy yeast-based breadsticks and are so delicious dipped in marinara!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
                <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F (45 degrees C)) </li>
                <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
                <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, divided</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line baking pans with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Dissolve yeast and honey in warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Let sit until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir flour, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and salt into the yeast mixture. Beat until smooth and the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Let rest, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and pinch off about 3 tablespoons. Roll into a log shape. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just golden brown, 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>While breadsticks are baking, mix butter, garlic salt, and remaining Italian seasoning together.</li>
                <li>Brush butter mixture onto the breadsticks and continue to bake until golden brown, about 3 minutes more.</li>
            </ol></p>
