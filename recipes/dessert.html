        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>So decadent yet so simple, you'll be saying 'flour who!?' when you let this sweet lava flow. Easy and delicious. Top with strawberries, chocolate syrup and a little powdered sugar and no one will know there's no flour!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p><ul>
                <li>8 ounces 70% bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
                <li>12 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Adjust a rack to the middle of the oven. Butter six 4-ounce ramekins.</li>
                <li>Put the chocolate and butter in a metal or glass bowl over barely simmering water. Stir occasionally until melted. Remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Place the eggs, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a mixer. Whip at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce speed to low and add the chocolate; mix until combined. Spoon into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 10 minutes or until the edges are set but the center is underdone. Let cool 3 minutes before serving.</li>
